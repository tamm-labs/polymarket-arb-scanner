# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Project name:** the GitHub repo and Railway service remain **`polymarket-arb-scanner`**. The codebase is *internally branded* "arbgrid" — a grid of platforms × layers × strategies, not a Polymarket-only scanner — but no GitHub/Railway rename has actually occurred. (A separate exploratory scaffold briefly held the `arbgrid` GitHub repo name; it was archived 2026-06 during the `~/Dev` arbitrage-cluster consolidation, along with a second `prediction-market-arb` scaffold whose Claude market-equivalence discovery was ported here as `market_discovery.py`.) Local clones may use any directory name without functional impact.

This repository supports autonomous trading services, but execution remains governed by current runtime configuration, venue eligibility, operator-owned risk limits, and kill-switch controls. Repository documentation is not transaction authority.

## Project Overview

Python CLI tool (`arbgrid`) that scans for arbitrage and trading opportunities across prediction markets. Supports one-shot scans, continuous mode with WebSocket feeds, and automated trade execution. Deployed to Railway via GitHub integration.

**Platforms**: Polymarket, Kalshi, Betfair, Smarkets, SX Bet, Matchbook, Gemini Predictions, IBKR ForecastEx (+ Metaculus and Manifold as read-only signal sources)

**Portfolio context:** arbgrid is **Lane A (prediction markets)** of the *Financial Markets — Algorithmic Capture* command center (`~/Financial Markets with AI/`). The command center owns portfolio-level strategy, capital, tax, secrets, and cross-engine P&L across all lanes; **this repo owns detection + execution code only.** Do not duplicate capital/tax/risk/secrets policy here — it lives in the command center (docs `00`–`15` + `GLOSSARY`). Linear: engine code backlog → the *Polymarket Arb Scanner* project; portfolio milestones (M1–M5) → the *Financial Markets — Algorithmic Capture* project.

**Strategy framework:** see [`docs/strategy-framework-v2.md`](docs/strategy-framework-v2.md) for the canonical 29-strategy / 5-layer reconciliation. The summary block below is informative; the framework doc is authoritative. Mode↔strategy bridge: [`docs/MODE-STRATEGY-MAP.md`](docs/MODE-STRATEGY-MAP.md).

## Project Scope

- **What does "done" look like?** Profitable 24/7 automated trading bot on Railway — **29 strategies across 5 risk layers** (pure arbitrage, near-arbitrage, market making + liquidity provision, informed/statistical edge, capital optimization) operating across all 8 platforms. Full-stack: detection, execution, risk management, market making, monitoring, and backtesting — all production-grade and battle-tested. Canonical strategy taxonomy lives in [`docs/strategy-framework-v2.md`](docs/strategy-framework-v2.md).
- **How will you know it's working?** All three: (1) Net positive P&L in trades.db over a 7-day live trading period, (2) <5% false positive rate on detected opportunities (manually verified against platforms), (3) At least one profitable round-trip trade executed without human intervention.
- **What is explicitly out of scope?** Public-facing product — no user accounts, SaaS interface, or selling access. This is a personal trading tool.
- **Scope status:** Active

**Strategies (29 across 5 layers — see `docs/strategy-framework-v2.md` for full status table)**:

*Layer 1 — Pure Arbitrage (risk-free):*
- **Binary/NegRisk internal** — same-platform overround arbs on Polymarket, Kalshi, Gemini, IBKR
- **Back-all/Back-lay** — exchange-specific arbs on Betfair, Smarkets, SX Bet, Matchbook
- **Cross-platform 2-way** — mispricings between any pair of 8 platforms (28 pairs)
- **Multi-outcome cross-platform** — cheapest YES per outcome across platforms
- **Triangular** — 3-way mispricings across 3+ platforms

*Layer 2 — Near-Arbitrage (near risk-free):*
- **Resolution sniping** — buy near-certain outcomes at a discount before settlement
- **Stale price exploitation** — trade against slow-updating platforms after price moves
- **Fee promotional arbitrage** — route through lowest-fee platform paths

*Layer 3 — Market Making (low risk):*
- **Passive market making** — bid/ask spread capture on liquid markets
- **Cross-platform market making** — opposing limit orders across platforms
- **Inventory-hedged MM** — cross-platform hedging to neutralize directional exposure

*Layer 4 — Informed Trading (moderate risk):*
- **Event divergence** — multi-source consensus vs platform price signals
- **Cross-platform convergence** — directional bets on outlier platforms converging to median
- **Multi-source signal aggregation** — weighted consensus from Metaculus, Manifold, prediction polls

*Layer 5 — Capital Optimization (multiplier):*
- **Dynamic fee routing** — lowest-fee path selection for each opportunity
- **Kelly criterion sizing** — optimal position sizing by strategy risk class
- **Platform fund rebalancing** — capital allocation across platforms by opportunity flow. *Auto-execute corridor: Gemini ↔ Polymarket via USDC on Polygon only. The other six platforms expose read-only balance APIs and stay on the manual-rebalance path with weekly digests via `notifier.py`.*
- **Latency optimization** — priority execution for time-sensitive opportunities
- **Backtesting-driven tuning** — historical data to optimize all thresholds
- **Spread detection** — Polymarket/Kalshi bid-ask spreads (existing, feeds into MM)

All original-framework strategies (#1-#20) are first-class as of the May 2026 milestone (PR #10, commit `1e5087b`). The codebase additionally implements 9 strategies that grew beyond the original framework (#21 spread detection, #22-#23 liquidity rewards, #24-#29 Layer 4 informed-trading variants). Per the v2 framework status table:

- **27 BUILT** — distinct opp type, scan/detection module, executor branch, tests (#1-5, 7-17, 19-29)
- **2 PARTIAL** — #6 (SX Bet quarantined for unsigned-JSON bug pending EIP-712 signing), #18 (Gemini↔Polymarket auto-corridor only by design)
- **0 STUB** — none remaining

*Updated 2026-05-20 after audit revealed #26 / #27 / #28 / #29 all have first-class Stage 2 refiners with substantial test coverage (48 / 36 / 76 / 58 passing tests respectively) — the prior PARTIAL/STUB labels were stale.*

> **Mode-vs-taxonomy note (2026-05-31 audit):** the canonical taxonomy is 29 strategies, but `cli.py` exposes **33 `--mode` scan values** (excluding `all`). The extra modes are execution variants / Layer-4 sub-strategies — `negrisk-no` (Strategy #2a), `nway`, `rewards`, `imbalance`, `news-snipe`, `correlated`, `time-decay`, `logical-arb`, `whale-copy`, `lead-lag-mm`, `toxic-flow`, `vol-mm` — that grew alongside the framework. The `--mode` set in `cli.py` is the source of truth for *runnable scans*; the 29-strategy table is the source of truth for the *risk-layer taxonomy*. A full mode→strategy reconciliation in `docs/strategy-framework-v2.md` is a tracked follow-up.

Each first-class strategy has a feature flag defaulting to `false`. The four flags added in PR #10:

| Flag | Strategy | Module(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `MM_AUTO_HEDGE_ENABLED` | #12 inventory-hedged MM | `hedger.hedge_inventory()` + `MarketMaker.on_fill` wiring |
| `FEE_PROMO_ENABLED` | #9 fee-promo arb | `near_miss_cache.py`, `scans/fee_promo.py`, `config.get_promo_expiry`, `notifier.notify_promo_warning` |
| `CROSS_MM_ENABLED` | #11 cross-platform MM | `scans/cross_mm.py`, `market_maker.CrossPlatformMaker` |
| `AUTO_REBALANCE_ENABLED` | #18 auto-rebalance | `treasury.py`, `gemini_api.withdraw_usdc`, `db.transfers` table, `POST /api/rebalance/execute` |

**Plan 10 (Kalshi reward-MM pilot):** `MM_KALSHI_PILOT_ENABLED` (default `false`) gates
`mm_pilot.KalshiMMPilot` — the safety layer for live Kalshi LIP/VIP quoting
(spec: `docs/plans/10-mm-pilot-prep.md`). Independent of the legacy `MM_ENABLED`
Polymarket path. Kalshi ONLY (hard-checked at the `authorize_order` choke point).
A live (non-dry-run) start refuses to boot unless `MM_AUTO_HEDGE_ENABLED`,
`MM_TOXIC_FLOW_ENABLED`, and `MM_VOLATILITY_ADJUSTED_ENABLED` are all true
(`validate_config` raises), and the Supabase `bot_controls.mm_pilot_enabled` kill
switch (migration 0004, seeded false) must be fresh AND true or the pilot pulls all
quotes. Rollout: D0 dry-run soak → D1 live canary (`MM_CANARY_*`) → D2 pilot sizing;
D1/D2 activation is an operator decision.

Remaining gaps and the build sequence to close them are documented in the v2 framework's Remediation Roadmap section.

## Architecture

The codebase has three layers and a thin orchestration shell:

### Orchestration (scanner.py → cli.py, continuous.py, display.py)

`scanner.py` is a **re-export facade** — it imports everything from the actual implementation modules and re-exports them so that `import scanner` continues to work for backward compatibility and test patching. The real entry point is `cli.py:main()`, which parses CLI args, initializes all platform clients, and dispatches to either `_run_oneshot()` or `continuous.py:run_continuous()`.

**Data flow in one-shot mode** (`cli.py:_run_oneshot`):
1. **Parallel fetch** — ThreadPoolExecutor fetches Polymarket markets, events, and Kalshi data simultaneously
2. **Parallel scan** — ThreadPoolExecutor runs binary, negrisk, kalshi_binary, kalshi_multi scans
3. **Sequential cross-platform** — cross/cross-all scans run after (they need data from step 1)
4. **Platform-specific scans** — spread, betfair, smarkets, sxbet, matchbook back-all/back-lay, gemini binary/multi, ibkr binary
5. **Advanced strategies** — event divergence (Metaculus signals), triangular (3-way cross-platform)
6. **Sort by capital efficiency** — `capital_efficiency_score()` ranks by ROI * depth
7. **Display + Execute** — results shown, then executor runs on each opportunity

**Continuous mode** (`continuous.py:run_continuous`) adds:
- `asyncio` event loop with graceful shutdown via SIGINT/SIGTERM
- `FeedManager` WebSocket feeds for real-time Polymarket + Kalshi prices
- `OpportunityIndex` maps (platform, ticker) → opportunities for O(1) WS-triggered execution
- Price cache with 60s TTL, shared between WS feeds and executor for revalidation
- Per-market locks prevent concurrent execution on the same market
- Crash recovery via `recovery.py:reconcile_orphaned_positions()` on startup

### Scan Layer (scans/ package)

Each scan module follows the same two-stage pattern:
1. **Mid-price scan** (fast) — uses REST API mid prices to find candidates
2. **CLOB refinement** (accurate) — re-checks candidates against actual ask prices via `_refine_*_with_clob()`

The `_refine` step can drop candidates that looked profitable at mid prices but aren't at ask prices.

Scan modules:
- `binary.py`, `negrisk.py` — Polymarket internal arbs
- `kalshi.py` — Kalshi binary + multi-outcome
- `cross.py` — 2-way cross-platform (all platform pairs)
- `spread.py` — Polymarket/Kalshi bid-ask spreads
- `betfair.py`, `smarkets.py`, `sxbet.py`, `matchbook.py` — exchange back-all/back-lay
- `gemini.py` — Gemini binary + multi-outcome (1.75% maker / 7% taker fees)
- `ibkr.py` — IBKR ForecastEx binary only (BUY-only, $0.00 commission)
- `multi_cross.py` — multi-outcome cross-platform (cheapest YES per outcome across Polymarket + Kalshi, fuzzy event-title matching)
- `triangular.py` — 3-way cross-platform (union-find grouping of pairwise matches)
- `stale.py` — stale price exploitation (detects slow-updating platforms). **Note:** In one-shot mode (`scanner.py` without `--continuous`), the stale scan runs but produces no results because it requires historical WebSocket price data to detect staleness. Use `--continuous` mode for real stale detection. One-shot mode logs an informational warning.
- `resolution.py` — resolution sniping (near-certain outcomes at a discount)
- `convergence.py` — cross-platform convergence (outlier price → median)
- `helpers.py` — shared utilities (token IDs, CLOB fetch, scoring)

### Execution Layer (executor.py, risk_manager.py, db.py)

`ArbitrageExecutor.execute(opp)` is the core execution path:
1. **Risk check** — RiskManager validates position limits, daily loss, balance, depth, reentry rules
2. **Gas monitor gate** — GasMonitor rejects if profit < dynamic gas+fee threshold (when enabled)
3. **Price revalidation** — re-fetches live prices; rejects if profit dropped >10% (adaptive floor)
4. **Dynamic sizing** — adjusts trade size based on depth and aggressiveness setting
5. **Order placement** — dispatches to platform-specific trader (PolymarketTrader, KalshiClient, MatchbookClient, etc.)
6. **Fill confirmation** — polls order status every 100ms for up to 2s
7. **DB logging** — records opportunity, trades, and position in SQLite (thread-safe with WAL mode)

### Platform API Clients

Each `*_api.py` wraps a platform's REST API with auth, retries (`tenacity`), and proxy support. Key auth methods:
- **Polymarket**: Ethereum private key → CLOB API (py-clob-client)
- **Kalshi**: RSA-PSS signed headers (key file or base64)
- **Betfair**: SSO login + API key
- **Smarkets**: API key session
- **SX Bet**: API key session — **READ-ONLY** (`place_order()` sends unsigned JSON; EIP-712 signing not yet implemented). `validate_config()` errors at startup if `sxbet` is in `ENABLED_EXECUTION_PLATFORMS` while `DRY_RUN=false`
- **Matchbook**: Username/password session auth (0% commission on predictions)
- **Gemini Predictions**: HMAC-SHA384 signed headers (API key + secret), 1.75% maker / 7% taker fees (`GEMINI_MAKER_RATE` / `GEMINI_TAKER_RATE`), full buy+sell. Fee formula per the CFTC 40.6 filing effective 2026-03-09: `roundup(rate × C × P × (1 − P))` — *not* the legacy `min(P, 1−P) × rate`. The old single `GEMINI_FEE_RATE=0.05` constant is superseded (slated for removal).
- **IBKR ForecastEx**: TWS API via `ib_insync` (IB Gateway socket), BUY-only (no sell), LMT-only, $0.00 commission, 5s order rate limit
- **Metaculus**: Authenticated `/api/posts` REST API, read-only signal source; requires an API token, access tier, and written commercial-use permission

### Supporting Modules

- `matcher.py` — Fuzzy title matching with `thefuzz` for cross-platform market pairing
- `fees.py` — Net profit calculators accounting for platform-specific fee structures (including `net_profit_triangular` for 3-way arbs)
- `hedger.py` — Partial fill hedger: sells filled legs when the other side fails (all trading platforms except IBKR — BUY-only)
- `gas_monitor.py` — Real-time Polygon gas price monitoring, dynamic fee thresholds replacing static MIN_NET_ROI
- `event_monitor.py` — Metaculus divergence signal detection (fuzzy-matches platform markets to Metaculus questions)
- `metaculus_api.py` — Read-only Metaculus client for community probability forecasts
- `manifold_api.py` — Read-only Manifold Markets client for probability estimates
- `signal_aggregator.py` — Multi-source probability aggregation (Metaculus, Manifold, weighted consensus)
- `price_tracker.py` — Rolling price tracker with staleness detection across platforms
- `market_maker.py` — Market making engine (QuoteEngine, InventoryTracker, QuoteManager)
- `position_sizer.py` — Kelly criterion + strategy-aware position sizing
- `notifier.py` — Async webhook alerts (auto-detects Slack/Discord/generic format)
- `dashboard.py` — Lightweight HTTP server exposing `/status` JSON endpoint
- `recovery.py` — Reconciles orphaned positions/trades after crashes (supports all 8 trading platforms)
- `config.py` — All constants backed by env vars with sensible defaults; `validate_config()` runs at import time
- `snapshot.py` — Historical price snapshot recorder (SQLite, thread-safe) for backtesting
- `backtest.py` — Replay engine that simulates execution over recorded snapshots (standalone CLI: `python backtest.py`)
- `alerting.py` — Structured rate-limited alerts with severity levels, integrates with `notifier.py`
- `metrics.py` — Stdlib-only metrics (counters, gauges, histograms) with Prometheus text exposition
- `dashboard_ui.py` — Dashboard HTML template served by `dashboard.py` at GET `/`
- `run_dashboard.py` — Standalone dashboard launcher for local testing

## Key Patterns

- **scanner.py is a facade**: Never add logic here. It only re-exports from `scans/`, `cli.py`, `continuous.py`, `display.py` for backward compatibility. Tests patch `scanner.<name>` which hits these re-exports.
- **Two-stage detection**: Mid prices (fast) → CLOB ask prices (accurate). All scan modules follow this.
- **Token ID resolution**: CLOB token IDs are extracted during scanning (`_extract_token_ids`) and attached to opportunity dicts as `_token_ids` for use during execution.
- **Opportunity dicts**: Opportunities flow through the system as plain dicts with standardized keys: `type`, `market`, `prices`, `total_cost`, `net_profit`, `net_roi`, `_token_ids`, `_clob_depth`, `_market_key`, etc. Internal keys prefixed with `_`.
- **Thread safety**: `TradeDB` uses a threading lock on all operations + SQLite WAL mode. Price cache is a plain dict updated from WS threads. Per-market locks in continuous mode prevent double execution.
- **Config precedence**: CLI args > env vars > defaults in `config.py`.
- **Parallel everything**: Data fetching, scanning, and execution all use `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- **`_build_legs` dispatcher**: `executor.py:_build_legs()` converts an opportunity dict into execution legs by switching on `opp["type"]`. When adding a new opportunity type, add the corresponding branch here and a matching `_revalidate` case.

### Adding a new opportunity type

1. Create the scan in `scans/<name>.py` following the two-stage pattern.
2. Add the fee function in `fees.py`.
3. Add a branch in `executor.py:_build_legs()` and a matching `_revalidate` case.
4. Wire it into `cli.py:_run_oneshot()` and `continuous.py` if applicable.
5. Add the mode string to `cli.py` argparse choices.

### Adding a new cross-platform pair

Add entries to `_CROSS_FEE_FUNCS` in `scans/cross.py` using `functools.partial(net_profit_cross_generic, buy_fee, sell_fee)`. All 28 pairs of the 8 trading platforms are already covered.

## Code Style

- **Python 3.11+**. Use modern union syntax: `X | None`, `list[float]`, `tuple[bool, str]`. Never use `Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple` from `typing`.
- Double quotes for strings. ~120 char soft line limit.
- Logging with `%`-style: `logger.info("Found %d opps in %s", count, market)`. (`executor.py` is the sole exception using f-strings.)
- Section separators: `# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------` (75 dashes) between logical sections.
- Three custom exceptions: `ConfigError(ValueError)` in `config.py`, `_RateLimitError(Exception)` in `kalshi_api.py` and `polymarket_api.py`.
- Relative imports within `scans/` package (`from .helpers import ...`), absolute elsewhere.

## Testing

Tests use `pytest` with `unittest.mock`. All tests are methods inside classes (no module-level test functions). No `conftest.py` exists; shared setup uses per-file `autouse` fixtures.

External SDKs are mocked via `sys.modules` stubs before importing the module under test (see `test_executor.py` for the pattern). Tests path-insert the parent directory for imports (no package install needed).

**`autouse` fixture caveat**: Fixtures that clean `sys.modules` must only remove the specific scan module under test (e.g. `scans.gemini`), never `scans.helpers` or `scans.__init__` — this prevents cross-test pollution.

Run a specific test: `pytest tests/test_fees.py::TestPolymarketFee::test_zero_when_sell_equals_buy -v`

## Agent Delivery Workflow

### Isolate and scope the work
- Refresh `origin/master`, then inspect `git status`, `git worktree list`, and open PRs before editing. Work from a dedicated task branch and isolated worktree based on the current `origin/master`; never edit, clean, stash, or reset the dirty canonical checkout.
- Use one branch per objective. If another branch, worktree, or PR overlaps the same files or subsystem, coordinate or serialize the work instead of racing it.
- Keep one PR to one purpose. Before commit and again before the PR, inspect `git status`, `git diff --stat`, and the complete diff. Exclude unrelated code, formatting, generated artifacts, dependencies, and secrets.

### Verify, review, and hand off
- For every change, run `git diff --check`. For `.coderabbit.yaml`, also run `ruby -e 'require "yaml"; YAML.parse_file(".coderabbit.yaml")'`.
- For Python or CI behavior changes, use Python 3.12 and run the same correctness gates as `.github/workflows/test.yml`: `ruff check . --select E9,F63,F7,F82` and `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`. Add the narrowest relevant regression test first when practical; do not weaken, skip, or relabel checks to obtain green status.
- Write an imperative, outcome-specific PR title. The PR body must explain why, what changed, exact verification and results, deployment or trading risk, and deferred work. State every unrun check.
- CodeRabbit reviews every non-draft PR incrementally. Address actionable findings with narrow fixes, push, and wait for CodeRabbit and `test` again. Do not resolve a thread without fixing it or recording why it is non-actionable.
- Before handoff, fetch `origin/master`, confirm the branch is current, inspect the final diff, and rerun affected verification after any branch update or conflict resolution. Required `test` and `CodeRabbit` checks, conversation resolution, and a mergeable state are mandatory; never bypass protection or force-push.

### Depot, merge, and production boundaries
- Depot supplies the managed runner only for `.github/workflows/test.yml`. Keep scheduled monitoring, market scans, digests, communications, and any deployment workflow off Depot unless a separate, explicit infrastructure task authorizes the change. Depot account settings, runner groups, cache or network policy, and usage caps are external account changes, not part of repository implementation.
- Never exercise a write-capable trading path during validation. Do not run with `DRY_RUN=false`, `--exec-mode full-auto`, a live launcher, order submission, fund movement, or production credentials. Tests must use mocks or read-only/dry-run paths.
- Stop at a review-ready PR for changes involving live order placement, risk or loss limits, funds, credentials or secrets, permissions or authentication, account or provider configuration, migrations, production infrastructure or configuration, scheduled external communications, or other destructive or hard-to-reverse effects. Obtain explicit action-time confirmation for the exact effect.
- Low-risk changes may use GitHub-native auto-merge only when the final diff is limited to `docs/**`, `tests/**`, and Markdown files other than `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`; the branch is current with `master`; required `test` and `CodeRabbit` checks pass on the latest commit; every actionable review finding is resolved; and GitHub reports the PR mergeable. Changes to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.coderabbit.yaml`, or any other delivery or review control require explicit action-time approval. Immediately before arming auto-merge, use read-only operating evidence to verify the Railway worker is dry-run and no opportunity is mid-execution; if that quiescent state cannot be verified, stop at the PR. Do not change trading state to manufacture a merge window. The ordinary Railway restart triggered by a qualifying merge is authorized as part of this repository's autonomous lane; runtime, dependency, workflow, launcher, broker, trading, risk, Docker, and Railway changes remain outside it. Do not create a workflow that bypasses GitHub branch protection or polls around a missing required check.
- After an autonomous or explicitly authorized merge, verify the remote result with `gh pr view <PR> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,statusCheckRollup`, fetch `origin/master`, confirm the merge commit is an ancestor, inspect the latest `Tests` run on `master`, and read back `https://arb-scanner-production.up.railway.app/healthz`. A merged commit or green PR checks alone do not prove a healthy deployment. If the deployment or health check fails, stop further autonomous delivery, report the failure, and follow only a repository-documented rollback path; never exercise a live trading path as a deployment test.

## CI / CD

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `pytest` on every PR to `master` (Python 3.12, installs both `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`).
- CI fails on any test failures or errors (zero tolerance).

## Deployment

- **Railway** auto-deploys on push to `master` via GitHub integration. Dockerfile-based build (`python:3.12-slim`). Health check: `/healthz` on port 8080.
- **Docker**: Runs `scanner.py --continuous` as entrypoint.
- **Data persistence**: `DATA_DIR` env var for `trades.db`

## Environment Variables

All env vars are defined in `config.py` with defaults. Key groups:
- Platform credentials: `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID`/`KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (or `_BASE64`), `BETFAIR_*`, `SMARKETS_API_KEY`, `SXBET_API_KEY`, `MATCHBOOK_USERNAME`/`MATCHBOOK_PASSWORD`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_SECRET`, explicit `IBKR_HOST`/`IBKR_PORT`/`IBKR_CLIENT_ID` (IB Gateway), and `METACULUS_API_KEY` plus `METACULUS_COMMERCIAL_USE_APPROVED=true` after written commercial API permission
- Execution: `DRY_RUN` (default: true), `EXECUTION_MODE`, `MAX_TRADE_SIZE`

- Proxies: `POLYMARKET_PROXY_URL`, `KALSHI_PROXY_URL`

### Railway Production Configuration

The following env vars should be set in Railway for production deployment (Railway Dashboard -> Project -> Service -> Variables):

**Feature Flags (all default to false in config.py):**
- `MM_ENABLED=true` — Enable market making engine
- `SNAPSHOT_ENABLED=true` — Enable price snapshot recording for backtesting
- `DYNAMIC_FEE_ENABLED=true` — Enable real-time Polygon gas monitoring
- `EVENT_MONITOR_ENABLED=true` — Enable signal aggregation; Metaculus also requires its API key and explicit commercial-use approval flag

**Market Making Tuning:**
- `MM_MIN_SPREAD=0.02` — 2% minimum spread width
- `MM_MAX_INVENTORY=500.0` — $500 per market inventory cap

**Dynamic Fees:**
- `POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com` — Polygon RPC for gas monitoring (or use Alchemy/Infura for reliability)

**Dashboard (required as of PR #18):**
- `DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0` — required for Railway's edge healthcheck to reach the container. Default in `config.py` is `127.0.0.1` (loopback) — without this override the healthcheck on `/healthz` will fail and Railway will mark the service down.
- `DASHBOARD_PASS=<strong secret>` — required whenever `DASHBOARD_HOST` is non-loopback. `validate_config()` raises `ConfigError` at startup if the host is non-loopback and the password is empty.

**Platform Credentials (all 8 trading platforms):**
Already documented above. Ensure ALL platform credentials are set for full cross-platform coverage: `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID`/`KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `BETFAIR_APP_KEY`/`BETFAIR_USERNAME`/`BETFAIR_PASSWORD`, `SMARKETS_API_KEY`, `SXBET_API_KEY`, `MATCHBOOK_USERNAME`/`MATCHBOOK_PASSWORD`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_SECRET`, `IBKR_HOST`/`IBKR_PORT`/`IBKR_CLIENT_ID`.

Note: `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` and `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID`/`KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` should already be configured from initial deployment. The IBKR connection requires IB Gateway running and reachable from Railway — requires a persistent IB Gateway host (not a local machine).

## OpticOdds CLI Integration

The `opticodds` CLI (`~/.local/bin/opticodds`) provides unified access to real-time and historical odds from 170+ sportsbooks including every exchange this project trades on: Polymarket, Kalshi, Betfair Exchange (back+lay), SX Bet, Sporttrade, Novig, BetDEX, Matchbook. Use for:

- **Cross-platform price validation**: `opticodds odds --fixture <id> --book polymarket,kalshi,betfair_exchange --json`
- **Exchange order book depth**: `opticodds odds --fixture <id> --book betfair_exchange --exclude-fees --json` (returns `order_book` + `source_ids`)
- **Historical odds for backtesting**: `opticodds odds --fixture <id> --book kalshi --historical --json`
- **Bet grading/settlement**: `opticodds grader --fixture <id> --market Moneyline --name "Team Name"`
- **Fixture discovery**: `opticodds fixtures --sport <sport> --active --json`
- **Live odds streaming**: `opticodds stream-odds --sport basketball --book draftkings,betfair_exchange --json`

Auth: `OPTICODDS_API_KEY` is set globally in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Full reference: `~/.claude/references/opticodds-cli.md`.

Prefer `opticodds` over direct HTTP when you need normalized cross-platform data. Prefer direct platform API clients (`*_api.py`) for execution and platform-specific operations (order placement, position management).

## Polymarket CLI + Skill Integration

The official `polymarket` CLI (`/opt/homebrew/bin/polymarket`, installed via the trusted `polymarket/polymarket-cli` brew tap) wraps Gamma, CLOB, Data API, Bridge, and on-chain CTF operations. Every command supports `-o json`. Use it for ad-hoc inspection, debugging, and validating scanner output against live data:

- **Market lookup**: `polymarket -o json markets search "<query>" --limit 5`, `polymarket -o json markets get <slug-or-id>`
- **Orderbook validation**: `polymarket -o json clob book <TOKEN_ID>`, `clob midpoints "T1,T2"`, `clob spreads "T1,T2"` — cross-check `_refine_*_with_clob()` results
- **Price history**: `polymarket -o json clob price-history <TOKEN_ID> --interval 1d` — backtesting data spot-checks
- **Portfolio reconciliation**: `polymarket -o json data positions <WALLET>`, `data trades <WALLET>` — verify against `trades.db` and `recovery.py`
- **Metadata**: `clob tick-size`, `clob neg-risk`, `clob fee-rate` per token

Keep using `polymarket_api.py` / `py-clob-client` for execution paths — the CLI is for inspection and tooling, not the executor.

The `web3-polymarket` agent skill (`~/.claude/skills/web3-polymarket/`) carries the full integration reference: L1/L2 auth, order types (GTC/GTD/FOK/FAK), tick-size/neg-risk semantics, WebSocket channels, CTF split/merge/redeem, and gasless relayer patterns. Load its reference files when working on `polymarket_api.py`, `ws_feeds.py`, or CTF-related execution.

**Geoblock caveat**: `polymarket clob geoblock` reports this machine's residential IP (US/MI) as blocked for trading endpoints — local order placement via CLI will fail. Read-only commands (markets, books, prices, data) work fine. Production execution runs from Railway (see `POLYMARKET_PROXY_URL` in config). Never store a private key in `~/.config/polymarket/config.json` (plaintext) — the CLI also reads `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`, which this project already manages via Infisical. Run CLI commands via `infisical run --env dev -- polymarket -o json <command>` so the key is injected as an env var for that process only; `~/.config/polymarket/config.json` should only ever hold non-secret fields (`chain_id`, `signature_type`).

## Agent Team Notes

When splitting work across teammates:
- **API layer** (`*_api.py`, `ws_feeds.py`) — platform integration, auth, data fetching (9 platform clients)
- **Analysis layer** (`scans/`, `matcher.py`, `fees.py`, `config.py`, `event_monitor.py`, `gas_monitor.py`) — detection logic, matching, profit calculation, signal processing
- **Execution layer** (`executor.py`, `risk_manager.py`, `db.py`) — trade execution, risk management, persistence
- **Orchestration** (`cli.py`, `continuous.py`, `display.py`, `scanner.py`) — entry points, loops, output

Avoid two teammates editing the same module. `cli.py` and `continuous.py` are large — coordinate carefully.

## Secrets (Infisical)
Secrets for this project live in Infisical (env `dev`), linked via `.infisical.json`. Run anything needing secrets with `infisical run --env dev -- <cmd>`; inspect with `infisical secrets --env dev`. The local `.env` is retained as a fallback — retire it once the run command is switched. Pre-commit secret scanning is active.
